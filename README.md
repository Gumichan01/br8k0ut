8-bit Platform game for Windows

## About ##

Br8k0ut is a platformer video game I made in the context of the [UOGBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/unofficial-gbjam1).

This game jam was a good opportunity to make something different from what
I have done before and to learn new things, such as tile mapping,
and some others things specific to a platformer video game.

This game was developed in C++ and uses [LunatiX](https://github.com/Gumichan01/lunatix) and
[TMXParser](https://github.com/Gumichan01/TMXParser)/[TSXParser](https://github.com/Gumichan01/TSXParser)

## Game system ##

No Jump, just move and dash. That's all you need to know.

## Control ##

- Left and Right Arrow: move
- Left Shift: dash
- F: Fullscreen
- ESCAPE: Quit the game


## Licence ##

The game is under GPL3 and every assets are under Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0.
